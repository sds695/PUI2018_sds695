## Citibike Hypothesis Test Peer Review Assignment

Author: Siddhanth Deepak Shetty (sds695)
Reviewer: Yuxuan (yw1665)

## 1. Hypothesis Formulation
Both the null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis are formulated correctedly and clearly. Siddhanth stated the two hypothesis both into words and formulae. Additionally, Siddhanth also explained the two representations used in the hypothesis, $\mu_A and \mu_B$, as well as the significance level.


## 2. Data Preparation
To prepare the dataset for the test, Siddhanth droped all the missing values and created a new variable, age, from birth year. Siddhanth used the right variables, age and trip duration, for the test, but Siddhanth did not dorp an unnecessary variable, birth year, which is not used in any figure and also won't be useful for the hypothesis test. Siddhanth should consider drop this variable after creating age. 
	

## 3. Test Suggestion
T-test (one-tailed ) would be the appropriate test. Because t-test is used to find out is there any significant different between two samples with the same dependent variable. By using the one-tailed t-test, Siddhanth will be able to figure out whether people below 40 years of age tend to have longer trip.

## 4. Variations
To make the test more interesting, Siddhanth can consinder:
1. Instead of setting a strict cut-off point at 40, Siddhanth can figure out the general relationship between age and trip duration. 
2. Adding a new control variable, like Weekday v.s Weekends, or usertype, to see whether age has differents effect on trip duration on different time or different people.
