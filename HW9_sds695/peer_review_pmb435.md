 ## Clarity
Pabloâ€™s plot of the population density in Santiago quite effective in directing my attention to areas of high population density.
## Esthetic
I found the color scheme very catchy and the size of the plot was as big as it could be in the Github page.
## Honesty
The methods Pablo used to come up with the plot were very clear. He included comments on each step and downloaded the data in a reproducible way. 
## Recommendation
I have three recommendations for this plot. I would recommend Pablo to focus on a bigger area than 1 km square as it becomes a lot of information on the map. Secondly, it would make it much easier to interpret if there were fewer color brackets as it becomes difficult to identify the middle colors in the map. Finally, a caption describing the findings of the map is necessary and would help us understand the map better.
